#### Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should have only one reason to change
* Separation of concerns. Different classes should be handling different, independent tasks/problems

#### Open-Closed Principle
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
>  If you keep going back and update the base class to extend it to add more functionality you should consider Object-Oriented Paradigm and inheritance

#### Liskov Substitution Principle
* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

#### Interface Segregation Principle 
* Don't put too much into an interface; split into several ones if you know that it some of the functionality might not be used
* YAGNI = You ain't going to need it

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level ones; Abstractions should be used instead
